## Dataset 1 （Semantic Segmentation Based on Temporal Features: Learning of Temporal–Spatial Information From Time-Series SAR Images for Paddy Rice Mapping，TGRS，2022）

### The training dataset are shared by google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/120X2tLv4-6pxIREOMFFGILId4R98gdWK?usp=sharing
### The dataset is generated from time-series Sentinel-1 SAR images in 2019 in AR,MS, MO, TN of the United States, and Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is used as the label data.
### The time-series Sentinel-1 SAR images is preprocessed and downloaded by Google Earth Engine and the linke of the code can be found below: https://code.earthengine.google.com/49f8e2532075272a79883ad8fbf41ccb
